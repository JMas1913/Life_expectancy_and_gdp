**Project description:** 
Life Expectancy and a Country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
Analyzed the correlation between a population’s life expectancy and their country’s GDP.

Gross Domestic Product, also known as GDP, is the market value of all finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period. It functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a given country’s economic health. A country’s higher national income, measured as GDP per capita, indicates its population will have an increased life expectancy at birth.

In this project, I analyzed the relation between the GDP and Life Expectancy at Birth of six different countries, comparing 15 years of data. The data used in this project is gathered from the World Health Organization (WHO). I would also love to connect with you on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanmastin1913).

Six countries were included in my analysis, being: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States of America, and Zimbabwe. For these countries, I went over the relationship of their GDP and Life Expectancy at Birth for the time period between the years 2000 and 2015.

**The questions posed to be answered are the following:**
1) Has life expectancy increased over time in any of the six countries analyzed?
  - Yes, with Zimbabwe having the greatest increase of all 6.
2) Has GDP increased over time in any of the six countries?
  - GDP has also increased for all six countries analyzed, and especially for China.
3) Is there a correlation between a country’s GDP and its population life expectancy?
  - There is a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy, with the average life expectancy rising steadily and significantly for five out of the six countries.
4) What is the average life expectancy in these six countries?
  - The average life expectancy was higher than 70 years for 5 of the six listed countries. Zimbabwe was the exception, where the average life expectancy was 50 years.
5) What is the distribution of the countries’ life expectancy?
  - As of 2015, the country with the highest life expectancy was Germany at 79.6 years old, followed by Chile and the US, respectively at 78.9 and 78 years old. Most of the countries with the lowest life expectancy are usually African countries, with Zimbabwe in our analysis having a life expectancy of mere 50 years old.

**Conclusions**
Although the data analyzed for this project had only 96 rows and 4 columns, we were still able to make quite a few data visualizations, and get answers to questions such as the correlation between GDP and a country’s life expectancy.

With this analysis and visualization we have also conclude the following:

Even though the GDP of the United States was approximately twice that of the other countries, the life expectancy was within the same range as all the others, except Zimbabwe. This indicates that a country’s GDP plays some factor in the life expectancy, but does not completely determine it. One good example of this is Chile, of the countries with a high life expectancy, Chile had a GDP similar to Zimbabwe.

**Further Research**
The study wanted to explore what happened in China between 2005 and 2015 that caused its GDP to increase so dramatically. This [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterpham/2018/03/06/is-there-a-secret-growth-hormone-added-to-chinas-economy/#40869ba53f13) describes how China's unmatched GDP growth in that decade were due to its large population, newly available capital, and manufacturing efficiency.
