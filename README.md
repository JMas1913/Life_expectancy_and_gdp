# Life_expectancy_and_gdp

**Project description:** In this project, I decided to look at the life expectancy of different countries population and compare it to that country's GDP. 
The countries that were examined were Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States of America, and Zimbabwe. The time period that I looked at was between 2000 and 2015.



### 1. The questions posed to be answered are the following:

1) Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
 - Yes with Zimbabwe having the greatest increase.
2) Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
 - GDP has also increased for all countries in our list, especially for China.
3) Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
 - Yes there is a positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy for countries in our list.
4) What is the average life expectancy in these nations?
 - The average life expectancy was between mid to high 70s for the countries except for Zimbabwe which was 50.
5) What is the distribution of that life expectancy?
 - the life expectancy had a left skew, or most of the observations were on the right side.
